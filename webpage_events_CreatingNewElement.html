<h2> HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE CANNAE </h2>

<p> The Battle of Cannae (/ˈkæni/ or /ˈkæneɪ/) is a major battle of the Second Punic War that took place on 2 August 216 BC in Apulia, in southeast Italy. The army of Carthage, under Hannibal, decisively defeated a larger army of the Roman Republic under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro. It is regarded both as one of the greatest tactical feats in military history and as one of the worst defeats in Roman history.
